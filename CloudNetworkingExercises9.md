1. CNI api is invoked by the PODs kubelet.
2. I can capture the traffic on the docker0 interface. 
3. Using Minikube dashboard I am able to modify the system. Though the overview tab I can add resources by specifying a yaml file. Also by selecting each resource or service we can modify it, by changing the manifest file. This action is equivalent to "kubectl apply -f <spec.yaml>"
