# What is NFV?
 NFV involves the implementation of network functions in software that can run on industry standard server hardware, and that canbe moved to, or instantiated in various locations in the network.
## Network Function
    A functional building block within a network infrastructure, which has well defined external interfaces and welldefined functional behaviour. Usually it is built around specific HW. Examples are Firewalls, Loadbalancers, switches...
# What is a vNF?
vNF is a NF but implemented in software, decoupled from specific hardware.
Utilizing vNFs instead of traditional NFs, we can: 
- Maximize HW reuse.
- Minimize electric consumption
- Increase flexibility and scalability

# Why is this interesting?
1) Reduced CAPEX & OPEX
2) Redundancy: infrastructure level + vNF level
3) Modularity: Functions as sets of Modules: Microservices mode(Cloud Native design)
4) Elasticity & ScalabilityH
# For who?
# What is SDN and how is it realted to NFV?
# Examples of NFV-based Telco services?
# What is ETSI NFV Framework
# What are its components
