1. I would map the network type as:
    - by Ownership <-> Internal. 
    - Provider Network <-> External

2. I would prefer to find a LinuxB based Openstack network, as it would be easier to troubleshoot.

3. On the other hand I would prefer to invest in a startup that is using OvS since it is a lot more scalable, and is able to use newer technologies like SDN and distributed routing.
