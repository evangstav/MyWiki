# Machine Learning in Network and Services Management

/home/evangelos/workspace/ArticlesAndStaff/EugenBorcoci_Tutorial_SoftNet2019.pdf

## Motivation

Current state in network and services:
    * Increased Complexity -> (integration of Cloud/Edge computing and networking)
    * Driving forces -> IoT, smart cities, industry, governance, energy saving

Example: Mobility in 5G -> - Open Issues, 
                           - smart slicing(Management & Control for 5G ulti), 
                           - autonomous troubleshooting 


Potential contributions:
- Adaptive pattern mining and forecasting:
    - traffic, user requests, churn, network conditions
- Feature extraction capabiltities:
    - Network Analytics
    - Security support
- RL for routing???

## Potential Usecases

- *Traffic Management and Control*
    - Traffic Prediction
    - Traffic classification

- *Spectrum Management in 5G*

- *Congestion Control*
    - Collect experience from Net-Simulator(Possibly make Net-Sim faster???)
    - packet loss classification
    - queue management
    - congestion window for TCP

- *Resource Management*
    - Admission Control
    - Resource reservation and allocation (e.g. for slices, VNFs) in multdomain contexts

- *Fault management*
    - Prediction
    - Detection
    - Localization
    - Mitigation -> Autonomous Procedures

- *Network Adaptation*
    - Routing Strategy
        - Traffic patterns labeling with routing paths computed by routing protocols
        - Route measurement
        - End-to-end path badwidth availability prediction
        - Decentralized/partially centralized routing

- *QoS and QoE management*
    - QoE optimization: Session quality information -> related with [t](SynthesisProjec.md)
    - QoS/QoE correlation supervised/Unsupervised
    - QoS prediction under QoS impairment

- *Network Security*
    - Intrusion detection
    - [n](Anomaly Detectio.md)

- *Mobile Networks*
    - Mobile Data Analysis
    - Mobility Analysis, User Location, Mobile Networks Applications

- *IoT*

## FCAPS
- F-ailure: detection and repairing
- C-onfiguration: of entities (physical, logical)
- A-ccounting of resource usage ( who, what, when, how much )
- P-erfomance evaluation (in order to check SLAs)
- S-ecurity
