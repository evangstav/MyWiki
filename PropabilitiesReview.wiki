== Random Variable, Atom Event ==
1) A random variable represents a set of values::
     1) It can take values in a sample space
     2) It can be discrete or continuous
2) The values of the random variable we call them atoms::
     1) A discrete probability distribution assigns probability to every atom in the sample space

3)  Event is a subset of atoms

== Joint Distribution ==
A distribution over the configuration of all the ranodm variable in the ensemble.
- Some Usefull properties::
Union: 
{{$
p(X \union Y) = p(X) + p(Y) - p(X,Y)
}}$

Marginalization: 
{{$
p(X) = \sum_{Y} p(X,Y)
}}$

== Conditional Probability ==
p(X|Y = y) = p(X,Y=y)/p(Y=y)

== Bayes Theorem ==
p(X|Y) = p(Y|X)p(x) / p(Y)

== Independence ==
Random variables are independent if knowing about *X* tell us nothing about *Y*
{{$
p(Y|X) = p(Y)
}}$
That means their joint distribution is p(X,Y) = P(X)*P(Y)
