# PGMs in continuous domain
- Agraphucal Model allows for a full bayesian treatment
- We can use domain knowlegde
- Good to prevent overfitting
- What would be the form of those priors

## Conjucate Priors
- For many known distributions, there is a corresponding conjucate prior, that preserves its form under multiplication.
- If we have a known closed model, inference is generally more efficient
- Great for online learning


Notes

- Covariance Matrix of Distribution??
