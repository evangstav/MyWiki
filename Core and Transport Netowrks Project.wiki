= Project in Security =

I had to take a project, and I was pushed towards a project in security. Let's hope it turns out well. I eventualy chose to do a DDoS detection project-survey, given that it is interesting and i have experience with the anomaly detection problem from my work at UoA-IASA.

= DDoS Detection =

== Project Structure ==

===Introduction===
* Why is it important
=== DDoS Theory ===
    * What is a DoS
    * What is a DDoS
    * Main Types of DDoS
=== [[Anomaly Detection|Anomaly Detection Theory]] ===

    * What is anomaly detection: 
      Define the anomaly detection problem in general and specifically in networks and DDoS attacks.
    * Methods of Anomaly Detection
        * Knowledge Based
        * Supervised
        * Unsupervised
        * Semisupervised
        Briefly Compare these 3 different approaches
    * Anomaly Detection Techniques
        There are many so briefly describe each one of them to write more lines

=== Implementations ===
Pick 3?? techinques already implemented and compare their implementations
    * Are thet tried?
    * In which part of the network they were deployed?
    * Metrics:
        * Accuracy
        * Precision
    * Perfomance:
        * Heavy
        * Can they be deployed on the edge or in the Core

 === Conclusion ===
Networks operator perspective:
    * Is it important? Why?:
        * Enterprises losing money
        * Healthcare in Danger
        * Network Operators to Blame
    * Which Algorithms seem to be the best?:
        * Propably an ensemple
    * Defend on different levels namely destination and source

== Notes ==

=== Machine Learning Detection Based DDoS defence Models ===
 
 Due to advance benefits of using machine learning approaches in classification, they are now considered the most prominent detection techinques used for DDoS detection.
