## Propabilitic Graphical Models
1) Nodes - Represent Random Variables
2) Arrows - Repesent Causal Relationships

## Why PGMs
1) Provide intuitive and compact way of representing the structure of a probabilistic model
2) Gives us insights about the properties of the model(e.g. relationships between variables, conditional dependencies)
3) Help us communicate and design new models
