# Exact Inference
We want to compute the exact posterior probability distribution over the variables of interest.
- Best possible solution
* Analytical Derivations:
    * High Computational Efficiency
    * However, quite often intractable
* Algorithmic Methods :
    * Variable Elimination
    * Message Passing


## Analytical Derivation
- The Gaussian has nice properties
- A multivariate Gaussian with $d$ dimensions is:
$$
N(x|m,\Sigma) = 1/((2\pi)^{D/2}|\Sigma|^{1/2})
$$

## Variable Elimination

## Belief Propagation
